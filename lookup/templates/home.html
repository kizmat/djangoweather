		 <p class="mb-0">As you read this sentence, your brain is telling your diaphragm to contract, your ribs to expand, air is passing through your trachea — you are breathing. Air is essential to human life, and yet the air we breathe can also be a source of great harm. 

		Globally, some seven million deaths each year are linked to the effects of air pollution, according to the World Health Organization, making it the biggest environmental killer. Pollution kills more people than car accidents, diabetes or dementia. 

		The effects are particularly pronounced for children, who can experience stunted lungs and lifelong cognitive impacts.

		But how bad, really, is the air we breathe? What does air pollution, often presented in abstract statistics, feel like in daily life? Can people in cities wrest any control over the level of pollution they experience? </p>
